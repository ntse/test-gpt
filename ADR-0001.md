# ADR-0001: Framework and Database Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The service catalogue API requires rapid development of a typed REST API with OpenAPI documentation, validation, and database persistence. The functional scope includes CRUD endpoints, CSV import, search, and operational probes. Non-functional requirements call for strong developer tooling, automated tests, and straightforward containerisation.

## Decision
Adopt **FastAPI** with **Pydantic v2** schemas for the web layer, combined with **SQLModel**/**SQLAlchemy** for ORM-style persistence. Use **PostgreSQL** in production (via Docker Compose) with **psycopg 3** and **SQLite** for tests.

## Consequences
- FastAPI provides automatic OpenAPI generation, dependency injection, and async-ready request handling, covering the API and documentation requirements with minimal boilerplate.
- Pydantic + SQLModel delivers declarative data validation and mapping to relational tables, enabling reuse of schema logic for CSV import and request bodies.
- SQLAlchemy compatibility allows switching between SQLite (fast, in-memory tests) and PostgreSQL (production) without code changes.
- The stack has broad ecosystem support (linting, testing, pipelines) aligning with the 48-hour delivery window.
